# Alpha_Training: English Alphabet Learning 
Alpha_Training is for English learners who mix up the pronunciation of the alphabet. Choose the letters (only vowels, consonnants or the whole alphabet) and give the right answer when you hear the letter. 
Practice with the training mode or test yourself with the Chrono 30' mode.
